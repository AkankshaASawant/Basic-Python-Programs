    "Converting a decimal number to binary, octal, and hexadecimal involves dividing the decimal number by the base repeatedly and noting the remainders at each step. Here's a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's convert the decimal number 27 to binary, octal, and hexadecimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary:\n",
    "- Divide 27 by 2. Quotient is 13, remainder is 1. Note the remainder.\n",
    "- Divide 13 by 2. Quotient is 6, remainder is 1. Note the remainder.\n",
    "- Divide 6 by 2. Quotient is 3, remainder is 0. Note the remainder.\n",
    "- Divide 3 by 2. Quotient is 1, remainder is 1. Note the remainder.\n",
    "- Divide 1 by 2. Quotient is 0, remainder is 1. Note the remainder.\n",
    "Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 27 is 11011.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Octal: \n",
    "- Divide 27 by 8. Quotient is 3, remainder is 3. Note the remainder.\n",
    "- Divide 3 by 8. Quotient is 0, remainder is 3. Note the remainder.\n",
    "Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the octal representation of 27 is 33.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Hexadecimal:\n",
    "- Divide 27 by 16. Quotient is 1, remainder is 11 (B in hexadecimal). Note the\n",
    "remainder.\n",
    "Reading the remainders, the hexadecimal representation of 27 is 1B.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary:\n",
    "Binary: 27 in decimal is 11011 in binary.\n",
    "Octal: 27 in decimal is 33 in octal.\n",
    "Hexadecimal: 27 in decimal is 1B in hexadecimal."
